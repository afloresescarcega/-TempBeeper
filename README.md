# -TempBeeper

Hi! This is an old hackathon project from CodeRED Hackathon. This was a simple program when attached to an arduino would measure the distance of a thing in front of it and if within a specific range (check the code) would beep if temperature was hot. This was a silly little proof of concept for alerting people that possibly a child was sitting inside of a hot car.
